# HIT_Numerical_Approximation
Here is my code for HIT Numerical Approximation's course projects (in python). Feel free to download &amp; use.

Hi guys, here I want to skip all useless dialogues, you know what is in this repo.
I wrote them on Jupyter Notebook, so you may need Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab to open them.
Anaconda provides an easy access to their installation, just in case you don't know.

Anyway, enjoy!
